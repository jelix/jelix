Changes into Jelix 1.8.0
========================

Not released yet.


Features
--------

* Jelix 1.8 is now compatible from PHP 7.4 to PHP 8.2.
* Core: 
  * new class `Jelix\Core\Services` that will allow to access to some services without using static methods of these service.
    The instance of this object is accessible from `\jApp::services()`.
    Warning: this is a work in progress.  
  * binary response: support of callback function to generate content. Can be used for streams, generator etc..
  * `jIncluder::incAll()`: it returns now the value returned by the including of the file generated by the compiler
  * Add an interface `jIActionSelector` on `jSelectorActFast` and `jSelectorAct`, to allow to provide other 
    implementation of action selector.
* Controllers:
  * new methods `redirect()` and `redirectUrl()` that are shortcuts to the creation of a redirection object
* jForms:
  * new method `BuilderBase::outputAllControlsValues()`
  * new method `BuilderBase::outputControlRawValue()`
  * new method `WidgetInterface::outputControlRawValue()`
* jAcl2Db admin UI: 
  * the user interface has been reworked to be more usable
  * possibility to hide some rights (`hiddenRights` in 
    the `acl2` configuration section)
  * It is not possible anymore to set some rights on the anonymous group (acl, or related to users)
  * rights are now dependent of the `view` right of the same branch.
* jEvent:
  * possibility to give an event object to `jEvent::notify()`. So you can have events having their own methods to manipulate
    information for the event.
  * Rework the implementation of the events dispatcher, to follows PSR-14. `jEvent::notify()`
    will be deprecated in futur versions, prefer to use Prefer to use `\jApp::services()->eventDispatcher()->dispatch($event)` for event objects. 
* Configurator:
  * The configurator is now able to declare automatically modules urls, and to remove
    all Urls of a module when it is uninstalled.
  * Module configurators can indicate a list of url to declare into the urls mapping 
  * more methods on XmlMapModifier to remove urls
  * new method `findProfile()` on helpers
* Installer:
  * The PreInstallHelpers class has now the database API to allows to check the
    content of the database before allowing the installation
  * new method `findProfile()` on helpers
  * new option to the installer command: `--no-clean-temp`. And the command verifies now that
    all content of the temp directory can be deleted.
* Unit tests: jUnitTestCase and jUnitTestCaseDb are deprecated. Use  
  `\Jelix\UnitTests\UnitTestCase` and `\Jelix\UnitTests\UnitTestCase` instead.
  Support of PHPUnit versions older than 6.0 is removed.
* the script runtests.php and the unit test mechanism for modules 
  (tests inside modules) are now deprecated.
  It is better to write tests outside modules, in order to not include them into
  Composer packages or other deployment system. It also allows you to use
  the PHPunit version you want, or to use other unit tests framework.



Removes
-------

* the template plugins `swfjs`, `swfbiscuit` and the script `jquery.flash.js`. Flash is dead, so no reason to keep these files.
* `$GLOBALS['JELIX_EVENTS']` does not exists anymore

Internal changes
----------------

* Upgrade Symfony Console to 5.2.1
* Upgrade PHPUnit to 8.5 for our tests
* Upgrade PHPMailer to 6.2.0
* Upgrade Jquery to 3.6.1
* Upgrade Jquery UI to 1.13.2
* Upgrade CKEditor to 35.3.0
* Upgrade Datatables to 1.12.1
* Tests with CasperJs have been removed
* Some Javascript scripts like `jforms_jquery.js` are now generated with WebPack. See the `assets` directory.

* jForms: move code from template plugin to a new class TemplateController.
  It allows to control the display of the form in a single class
  instead of into several template plugins, and so, to use it into any or 
  outside a template system.
